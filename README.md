## What is Helwan Store?

The Exodia Store is a **GUI (Graphical User Interface) package manager**. Its primary goal is to provide a user-friendly way to manage all your software, making the powerful Arch Linux package system accessible to everyone.

## Why Use Helwan Store?

| Benefit | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simplicity** | Install or remove any application with a single click, just like an app store on your phone. |
| **All-in-One Source** | Access packages from all three major sources in one place: **Official Arch Repositories**, the **Exodia Repository**, and the **AUR** (Arch User Repository). |
| **System Health** | Easily check for and apply system-wide updates to keep your entire OS secure and up-to-date. |
| **Search & Filter** | Quickly find the software you need by searching or filtering by category and repository type. |

## How to Get Started

1.  **Search:** Use the search bar to look for an application (e.g., Firefox, VLC, GIMP).
2.  **Filter:** Use the drop-down menus to narrow your results by Category (e.g., Multimedia, Development) or **Repository** (Arch, Exodia, or AUR).
3.  **Install:** Click the **Install** button next to the package you want. The store handles all necessary system commands (`pacman` or `yay`) securely in the background.

## System Maintenance

* **Check for System Updates:** Use the **Check for System Updates** button to see if any package on your system needs to be upgraded.
* **Apply Updates:** Click **Apply Updates** to perform a full system update (`pacman -Syu`) securely through the store's interface.
